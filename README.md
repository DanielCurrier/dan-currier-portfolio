# Daniel Currier's First Portfolio

## Description
As a fledgling full-stack student, my goal for this project is to use this website as a testing ground and library for upcoming works, as well as using it as a test for my front-end skills at this stage of my education. After many hours of studying and practice, I have a product that is close to what is described in the project's reference gif, but it is clear to me that I have much still to learn, and I am looking forward learning more!
